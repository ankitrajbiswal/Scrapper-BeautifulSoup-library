# Scrapper-BeautifulSoup-library

To run this code, you'll need to have the BeautifulSoup library installed. 
You can install it by running pip install beautifulsoup4 in your terminal or command prompt.

Make sure to replace "your_username" with your actual Instagram username.
The code sends a GET request to your Instagram following page, extracts the HTML content, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the content and extract the username and bio for each user profile.
The script then prints the username and bio for each user.

Please note that scraping Instagram data may be subject to Instagram's terms of service and any legal restrictions. Make sure to review and comply with their guidelines and policies when scraping data from their platform.
