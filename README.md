# Scrapper-BeautifulSoup-library

To run this code, you'll need to have the BeautifulSoup library installed. 
You can install it by running pip install beautifulsoup4 in your terminal or command prompt.

Make sure to replace "your_username" with your actual Instagram username.
The code sends a GET request to your Instagram following page, extracts the HTML content, and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the content and extract the username and bio for each user profile.
The script then prints the username and bio for each user.


To install the BeautifulSoup library, you can use pip, which is a package management system for Python. Here are the steps to install it:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install BeautifulSoup using pip:

   ```
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

   If you're using Python 3, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:

   ```
   pip3 install beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. Wait for the installation to complete. Pip will download and install the necessary packages and dependencies for BeautifulSoup.

Once the installation is finished, you can import the BeautifulSoup module in your Python scripts and start using it for web scraping tasks.

Remember to run the installation command in the same environment where you'll be running your Python code. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python packages.
